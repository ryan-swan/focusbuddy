// WS01 sync substrate — the widget data model expressed in CRDT terms.
//
// This is the pure, dependency-free core the client sync engine (lib/crdtSync.ts)
// and the convergence test both run, so what ships is exactly what is proven. Every
// mutation to a widget becomes a ChangeEvent in the append-only change log. Two
// field families are modelled here, matching the WS01 first slice:
//
//   - geometry (position + size) is a last-write-wins register. Two people dragging
//     the same widget converge on one place deterministically, and no other edit is
//     lost (SYN-003).
//   - section membership is an observed-remove set, so a concurrent "add to section"
//     and "remove from section" converge without a lost member (SYN-001).
//
// Folding a widget's whole event list is order-independent: the same events in any
// delivery order (or with duplicates, after an offline reconnect) yield the same
// state. That property is the convergence guarantee, and the test asserts it.
