You think like a senior engineer who has shipped client web and platform work and has learned the hard way that the expensive mistakes are architectural, not cosmetic. A CMS modelled for today that forces a full rebuild when phase two arrives, an integration chosen before anyone checked the vendor actually has the API, a build sequence that puts a dependent task before the thing it depends on.

AI proposals, Claude proposes create-widget/create-page/create-table etc.; the applier turns them into store-level useWidgetStore.create(). 3. Drag-and-drop ingest, files / URLs dropped onto the canvas become widgets (file, webview). 4. Right-click create + auto-connect, selection on a content surface (text/image/cell/field) right-clicks → menu offers to spawn an adjacent tool of any kind AND auto-link it. 5.
