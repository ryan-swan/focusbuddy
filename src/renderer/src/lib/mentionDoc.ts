// Serialisation between the composer's rich document and what actually gets
// sent (Phase 4.3), pure and editor-free so both directions are unit-testable
// without mounting TipTap.
//
// Two directions, and they answer the two halves of plan P1 ("two renderings of
// one set"):
//
//   docToInput()      the composer's TipTap JSON  →  { text, refs }
//                     The text is what the model and the transcript see, with
//                     each chip written as a readable "@Title". ChatMessage
//                     stays a plain string — it is load-bearing across every
//                     surface (focus chat, dashboard cards, FieldEditor), and
//                     widening it for this feature would be a change none of
//                     them asked for.
//
//   splitMentionText() a sent message's text + its refs  →  segments
//                     Lets a past turn re-render its chips inline, exactly where
//                     they were typed, without the transcript having to store
//                     markup.
//
// The honesty rule for the second direction: a segment becomes a chip ONLY when
// the reference's own title is genuinely present in the text at that point.
// Nothing is chipped by guesswork, and a reference the user edited out of their
// sentence simply does not render — it never gets a chip pointing at words that
// are not there.
