// Where should a NEW widget land when it is spawned by any path other than a
// deliberate drag-and-drop or a right-click-at-cursor add?
//
// The paths in scope are the "+" palette add button and every AI applier
// (create-widget, open-url, create-page, create-table, create-todo, create-
// field). Historically those dropped the widget at the viewport centre with
// jitter, or worse, at a fixed canvas (60, 60) for the AI paths, which put it
// high and far away so the user had to hunt for it and drag it into view.
//
// The rule here: snap the new widget to the immediate RIGHT of the widget the
// user last touched (the active widget), if there is clear space there. If the
// right is occupied, try the LEFT. If neither immediate side is free, slide to
// the nearest clear slot near the active widget. With no active widget (or when
// the active widget is so far off-screen that snapping beside it would repeat
// the very problem we are fixing), fall back to the centre of the current
// viewport and slide to the nearest clear slot so we never stack on top of
// whatever is already there.
//
// The geometry is pure and lives in computeSpawnPosition so it can be unit
// tested. spawnPositionFor is the convenience wrapper that reads the live store
// snapshot plus the on-screen canvas size and returns a concrete {x, y}.
