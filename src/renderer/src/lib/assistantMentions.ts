// The assistant's @-mention reference layer (Phase 4.1), pure and store-free —
// the same pattern as lib/assistantPin and lib/assistantQuestion. These rules
// decide what a reference IS, when one may be added, and when the set clears.
// The composer and the store only perform what they decide.
//
// This generalises click-to-pin (3a.1) from ONE widget to N typed references
// (plan D7/D8): a click and a typed "@" both produce a chip in the same layer,
// all chips are equal, and all are sticky to the CONVERSATION rather than to a
// single message — "primarily referenced in the conversation", exactly the P2
// lifecycle the pin already shipped, now with cardinality.
//
// Distinct from the three other "pin"-shaped concepts in the tree, deliberately:
//   • stores/chat `pinnedThread` — a CONVERSATION kept across navigation.
//   • widgets `pinned`/`pinnedZone` — a widget docked to a canvas corner.
//   • lib/mentions.ts — PlexiChat's @handle TEXT tokens, which notify a person.
// A MentionRef is none of those: it is a typed, id-bearing reference to a real
// workspace object, resolved to real content before it may claim anything.
