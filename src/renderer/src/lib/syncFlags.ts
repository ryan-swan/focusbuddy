// Each object type rides the CRDT change log alongside the twenty-second workspace
// poll (the design's dual-write rule: the poll stays as the backstop, so a dropped
// frame or a not-yet-migrated field never loses data). Every type is now proven live
// across all three partition scopes (account, org, shared desk) and the signal is
// deployed, so as of the lock-retire rollout these DEFAULT ON.
//
// Default ON, with an explicit off-switch: `localStorage['fb.sync.crdt.<type>']`
// unset or '1' is ON; only the literal '0' turns a type off. This is what makes
// shared-desk canvas collaboration real (it rides widgets + nodes + tables + links),
// which is the prerequisite for retiring the check-out lock. If localStorage is
// unreadable we fail safe to OFF (poll-only) rather than starting the engine blind.
