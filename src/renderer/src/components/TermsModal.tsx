            <p>
              PlexiDesk is local-first. Your tasks, widgets, documents, browsing history and
              preferences live on your device. If you stay signed out, nothing leaves your machine.
              When you sign in, the features you choose to use send the data they need to PlexiDesk's
              servers. Cloud sync keeps your workspace in step across your devices, and sharing,
              chat, meetings and mail exchange content with the people and services you point them
              at. You can export your data at any time, and keeping your own backups of work that
              matters is still wise.

            <p>
              AI runs one of two ways. With your own Anthropic key, pasted under{' '}
              <strong>Settings → AI · API keys</strong>, the assistant, AI Setup and resume features
              call Anthropic's API directly from the app. The key is encrypted with your system
              keychain and is sent only as part of those outbound requests. On a managed plan,
              PlexiBrain requests are relayed through PlexiDesk's server to Anthropic instead. Either
              way, AI requests include the workspace content needed to answer them, and you are
              responsible for the usage on your own key.

          <section>
            <h4 className="text-[var(--ink-100)] font-semibold mb-1.5">3. AI output is best-effort</h4>
            <p>
              The assistant can be wrong, miss context, or hallucinate. Treat its suggestions as a
              starting point — not as advice or instruction. Verify anything important before
              acting on it.

            <p>
              Pages you open in browser widgets are loaded directly from the source. Their terms,
              cookies, and tracking are governed by those sites, not PlexiDesk. Avoid logging in
              to anything you wouldn't want stored in this Electron app's profile.

            <p>
              PlexiDesk is a productivity tool, not a medical or therapeutic device. It is not a
              replacement for medication, therapy, or professional support for ADHD or executive
              dysfunction. If something here helps — great. If it doesn't — your brain isn't
              broken, this tool just isn't the right fit.
