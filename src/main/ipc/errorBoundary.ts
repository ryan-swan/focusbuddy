// One error boundary for every ipcMain.handle channel.
//
// Electron serialises a rejected handler's name, message AND stack back to the
// renderer. That means a handler which lets a raw error escape hands the
// renderer main-process implementation detail: better-sqlite3's "Too few
// parameter values were provided", a filesystem errno, and absolute paths that
// disclose the username and install layout. An audit of a booted build found
// 150 channels answering malformed input with a raw database error and 218
// sending a main-process stack trace.
//
// The contract deliberately does NOT change: a failing handler still rejects, so
// every existing `.catch()` in the renderer keeps working. What changes is what
// travels with the rejection:
//
//   - a domain message the app wrote on purpose ("Work items are not enabled.")
//     is passed through untouched, because the renderer shows it to the user;
//   - a message carrying internal detail is replaced with a generic one and the
//     real error is logged in main, so nothing is lost for debugging;
//   - the stack is replaced in both cases, since a stack is only ever
//     main-process file paths and the renderer has no use for it.
//
// This is installed by intercepting ipcMain.handle once, before any handler is
// registered. Electron exposes no hook for this, and the alternative — editing
// ~500 call sites — is a far larger change to review and an easy one to forget
// at the next handler.
