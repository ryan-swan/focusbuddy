// Settings, so on a real workspace they had produced nothing at all: zero rows
// of document metadata, meaning the enriched grounding header - Category, Dates,
// Mentions, Summary - had never once rendered.
//
// These wrappers put them on the same footing as the chunk sweeps: deferred off
// the boot path, bounded per tick so the local model is never hammered, ledgered
// by content hash so unchanged documents are skipped, and honest when the local
// model is absent (nothing is written and the reason is returned).
