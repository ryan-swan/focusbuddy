// rule: the claim is made ONLY about material that genuinely rendered below.

// The rule matters more here than it did for the pin. A pin was one widget on
// the desk in front of you; a reference set can name six things across the
// workspace, any of which may have been deleted, emptied, or (for a person)
// not be buildable yet. Every one of those cases must produce zero language.
//
// renderMentions returns the block AND the per-reference character counts that
// actually reached it, so the report the renderer receives is derived from the
// same pass that built the prompt. Two separate walks would be two things to
// keep in sync, and the day they drift a chip starts claiming a reference the
// model never saw.
